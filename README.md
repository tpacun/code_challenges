# Code Problems, Puzzles, and Challenges

I try and complete at least one coding problem a day from websites such as CodeWars, Leet Code, and others.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python, JavaScript (so far...)

Though these problems often aren't representative of the actual work of developing technical solutions, I really enjoy using these as a good way to learn the basic uses of new languages as well as brushing up on syntax and discovering new and intersting uses of built-in methods.

## Optimizations

After solving a problem, I'll always browse the other solutions that have been submitted. If I notice something an interesting alternative answer that approaches the problem in a different way, I'll open an issue on that solution so I can come back, review the problem, and try solving in a more efficient or logical manner.

## Lessons Learned:

Being an engineer means continuously learning! These types of problems are often maligned but I actually really enjoy them and getting to see the growth as I try to complete more and more difficult problems is awesome.
